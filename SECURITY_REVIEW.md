# Security Review Checklist

## Overview
This document contains the security review findings for the YouTube Viral Video Dashboard application.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Using Supabase Auth for authentication
- [x] Social login providers (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- [x] Email/password authentication
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) policies on database tables
- [x] Protected routes with authentication checks
- [x] User session management

### Security Measures:
- JWT tokens handled by Supabase
- Secure cookie storage for auth tokens
- HTTPS enforced in production
- OAuth redirect URLs properly configured

## 2. API Security ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Rate limiting on YouTube search API (`/api/youtube/search`)
- [x] Input validation on all API endpoints
- [x] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [x] CORS properly configured by Next.js

### Security Measures:
- Rate limiter prevents API abuse (50 requests/hour per IP)
- Query parameters are validated and sanitized
- No direct database queries from client
- API keys stored in environment variables

## 3. Data Protection ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Environment variables for sensitive data
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [x] Database connection through Supabase client
- [x] RLS policies enforce data access control

### Security Measures:
- YouTube API key never exposed to client
- Supabase anon key is safe for client-side use
- User data isolated by RLS policies
- No PII stored unnecessarily

## 4. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Search queries are validated
- [x] Filter parameters are type-checked
- [x] No SQL injection possible (using Supabase ORM)
- [x] XSS protection via React's automatic escaping

### Security Measures:
- All user inputs go through validation
- TypeScript provides type safety
- Supabase handles SQL parameterization
- React prevents XSS by default

## 5. Dependencies & Supply Chain ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Regular dependency updates
- [x] No known vulnerabilities (npm audit clean)
- [x] Using trusted packages only
- [x] Lock file committed (package-lock.json)

### Recommendations:
- Set up automated dependency scanning (Dependabot)
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- Monitor for security advisories

## 6. Content Security Policy ⚠️

### Current Status:
- [ ] No CSP headers configured

### Recommendation:
Add Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS attacks:
```typescript
// In next.config.mjs
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
          value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:;"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 7. HTTPS & Transport Security ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] HTTPS enforced on Vercel deployment
- [x] Secure cookies for auth tokens
- [x] No sensitive data in URLs

### Recommendations:
- Add HSTS header for production
- Ensure all external resources use HTTPS

## 8. Error Handling & Logging ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Sentry integration for error tracking
- [x] Errors don't expose stack traces to users
- [x] Proper error boundaries in React
- [x] Structured error responses from API

### Security Measures:
- Production errors are generic
- Detailed errors only in development
- Sentry filters out sensitive data

## 9. Session Management ✅

### Current Implementation:
- [x] Secure session handling via Supabase
- [x] Automatic token refresh
- [x] Logout clears all session data
- [x] No session fixation vulnerabilities

## 10. File Upload Security ✅

### Current Status:
- No file upload functionality (not needed)

## Security Best Practices Implemented:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (RLS, API validation, rate limiting)
3. **Secure by Default**: Using secure defaults from Next.js and Supabase
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
5. **Output Encoding**: React handles output encoding automatically
6. **Authentication**: Robust auth system with social login
7. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
8. **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security scanning

## Recommendations for Production:

1. **Add Security Headers**:
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - Referrer-Policy
   - Permissions-Policy

2. **Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall)**:
   - Use Cloudflare or similar service
   - Configure DDoS protection

3. **Implement Security Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track API usage patterns

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Quarterly dependency updates
   - Annual penetration testing
   - Code security reviews

5. **Data Encryption**:
   - Ensure database encryption at rest
   - Use encrypted connections everywhere

## Compliance Considerations:

- **GDPR**: User data deletion, data portability
- **CCPA**: Privacy policy, data access rights
- **COPPA**: Not collecting data from users under 13

## Security Contacts:

- Security issues should be reported to: security@yourdomain.com
- Use responsible disclosure practices
- Security patches will be prioritized

## Conclusion:

The application follows security best practices and is ready for production deployment. The main recommendations are to add security headers and set up ongoing security monitoring. No critical vulnerabilities were found during this review.
